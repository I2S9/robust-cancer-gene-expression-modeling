# robust-cancer-gene-expression-modeling

Research-oriented machine learning project for robust multi-class cancer type classification from high-dimensional gene expression data (TCGA subset).

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/` - raw input files (`data.csv`, `labels.csv`) kept locally only
- `data/processed/` - intermediate processed datasets
- `src/` - reusable Python modules
- `notebooks/` - experiment notebooks
- `results/figures/` - generated plots
- `results/tables/` - generated evaluation tables

## Current Status

Initial repository and folder structure are set up. The repository is intentionally data-free.
